This is a web-based 2D visualization of a car object in javascript.
Built this in preparation for my presentation on javascript objects,
constructors and closures.

For beginners, learning to code can get quite boring. One reason being that
we are visual beings but the initial stage of learning won't allow
for instant visual gratification from your code as it may involve many
console/terminal apps.
I believe a well put together graphical interface with these coding
principles would help a lot of persons understand and truly appreciate
the code they write.
